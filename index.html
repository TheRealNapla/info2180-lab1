<h2>Peter Thelwell</h2>
<p>I am a student that is also currently doing an internship. I enjoy working out, playing videogames and spending time with my friends. 
    I hope to learn alot in this course and to excel as well! I am interested in Web Development because I want to learn how to create websites that are both stylish and functional.
